<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hey I'm Dan a web developer who's main focus has been Angular.  I've been working with Angular since version 0.xx
  and in that time have been responsible for the migration of a number of large AngularJS code bases to Angular.  It's
  not a pretty job but someone has to do it.
</p>

<p>I haven't always been a developer.  My previous jobs have actually been very different.  Prior to becoming a web developer I was
  essentially another sort of developer but in construction where I me and a small team worked on a number of barn conversions.
  I enjoyed getting my hands dirty for that brief period and learning the tricks of the trade which are still saving me a pretty penny today.
  Prior to that I spent 6 years in the Navy working in the survival branch. During this time I was responsible for teaching sea survival
  techniques and even managed to train some celebrities on the way including Sir Lenworth George Henry.. better known as Lenny Henry.
</p>

<p>To be honest I have always brushed paths with celebs while working.  One of my greatest claims to fame was serving Chumbawamba
  ice cream when I worked behind a bar at a concert venue many years ago.
</p>

<p>I also spent 6 years in construction getting my hands dirty and learning the tricks of the trade which are still saving me a pretty
  penny today.  I'v been involved in most aspects of building including a number of barn conversions which was hard work but rewarding.</p>

<p>When I'm not mixing with celebrities or working I will likely be spending time with my family.  A lot of the time this involves driving
  around the countryside in our VW camper with the kids and crazy Doberdor dog.  We try to get out in the van as much as possible, wether
  it's a drive up the road to the New Forest or to a VW festival where I can relax with a few craft beers watching relatively unknown but
  fairly decent Ska bands perform
