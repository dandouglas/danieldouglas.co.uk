At the time of writing I have been working in the World of tech for about a decade.  In that time I have applied for 4 roles and have had a 100% success rate so far.  That's it, that's all I wanted to say.  I am amazing and clearly was always the best developer that had applied for those roles.

Ok that last part was probably not accurate... I don't know for sure but I would be willing to bet a small amount of money that I wasn't the best developer that applied for those roles.

So why did I get offered the job and not any of the other candidates?

I don't know for definite but I hope this article will provide others with help and advice to land that dream job.  The biggest hurdle of all is securing that first role in tech.  Once you have that under your belt then it should get easier.  I'll be honest, I think I was lucky to get my first tech job.  I immediately formed a bond with the interviewer over our mutual appreciation of Pearl Jam within the fairly early stages.  This is something I talk about later but that question that some people dread... you know the one... "Tell me a bit about yourself" is your greatest allie.  After that the interview felt nothing more than a casual chat.

I was certainly not technically ready for the position I was offered.  I had just finished my first two years at Uni and decided to leave with a Foundation Degree rather than incur the costs of the third year to gain a degree in Computer Science and the role wasn't even for a junior.  I was expected to lead a large team of developers to build a bespoke management solution.  

Therefore I would say this advice is more for the mid to senior level developers.  Securing that first role in development is not easy.  I was probably lucky to be interviewed by someone who had similar music tastes and I was cheap... very cheap.  My expected wage was well below what a developer would usually be paid and I had made sure I had a good portfolio of work.  It paid off though, it wasn't a job I particularly enjoyed but it paved the way for my future positions.

# Job Interview Tips

1. They need you more than you need them


## Relax and try to enjoy it

Ok so I appreciate this is easier said than done but just try to relax, smile and enjoy the process.  First impressions go along way and meeting someone who is smiling will help to make that first impression a good one.

If you are relaxed and smiling then the chances are the interviewers will connect with you. One of the most important factors when interviewing for potential new employees is ensuring that they will be a good fit for the company regardless of technical abilities.  It also works the other way, if I was interviewed by someone who didn't smile and made me feel uncomfortable then I wouldn't want to work for them.  However, if you are applying for that first junior role then you may not haver any choice but see it as a stepping stone to that cool office that throws a party every Friday afternoon.

A smiling person will look confident and approachable.  Most people will want to work with someone who is happy in what they do... it's time to demolish the myth of grump devs.


## Dress appropriately for the company

This is very much related to my previous point about being a good fit for the company.  However, there is no hard and fast rule for what to wear to a job interview. This is particularly true when applying for development roles.   You need to look into the company culture and the values that they deem important.

We've all seen tv programs about tech companies and startups with twenty something year olds zip wiring into the office in a pair of shorts and flip flops.  I would hazard a guess that if you turned up to an interview for a company like that whilst dressed in a sensible grey three piece suite, shiny shoes with your nervous sweaty palms gripping a briefcase then they may not think you are a great fit.

On the same note, if it's a very corporate company where most of the employees dress in smart business attire and you turn up dressed like a skater.. the likelihood again is that will not see you as a great fit no matter what your technical skills are like.

I've picked a couple of extremes there but you get the point.  At the end of the day you will be spending a lot of time at work and you want to ensure it's an environment you feel comfortable in as well.  If you hate wearing business attire then don't apply for roles that require you to do so.

If you are unsure as to what the company culture is then I would pick an outfit that sits in the middle.  Go for smart casual... and remember to smile!

## Don't be late but don't be too early

I've interviewed for many roles and people that turn up late is never the greatest first impression.  There is rarely any good reason for being late... especially if you are interviewing remotely via video call.  If the interview is on premise then I always carry out a dry run before attending the interview.  Do the journey at least once to make sure you can find the building and know exactly where to park on the day if you are driving.  You do not want the stress of frantically trying to find parking or the building on the morning of the interview.  This will stress you out and you want be able to put on your best performance.

Equally don't be too early.  If you are too early it could potentially frustrate the interviewer who may feel obliged to stop what they are doing to interview you early as it's a small office and they don't want you hovering around the desks.  You also run the risk of bumping into another candidate and maybe they are super confident looking and then your brain decides that they are clearly better than you and you end up going to pieces through self doubt and nerves.

Get there 5 minutes early.. no later and no sooner.

## Practice your answers to common questions

I won't spend too much time on this one as there are plenty of other resources out there on common interview questions and example answers but just make sure you are ready for them.  You know the questions I am talking about... "What are your main weaknesses?" and "What can you bring to this company" etc..  No more so than the one that I will guarantee 100% that you will be asked "Tell me about yourself".

Personally I would keep the answers relatively short and avoid waffling.  In the past I have asked someone to tell me about themselves and they gave me their entire life story from birth.  For that particular question in tech I would concentrate on a brief overview of the profession technical aspects of your life but finish with a very short sentence about any hobbies or interests you have in hope of striking a common bond with the interviewer.  As this question is always asked very early on in the interview it gives you that opportunity to find common ground with the person you are talking to.


## Have a side project

Have at least one side project that shows off your technical skills.  It doesn't need to be extensive but just make sure that the code is cleanly written and demonstrates the skills you possess.  Please, please, please don't turn up to an interview and show them your current or any previous employers codebase... not unless you have been given prior consent.  I have stopped interviews short in the past when candidates have done this... especially when they start showing the intricacies of the authentication module.  An employer will not want you working for them if they think you are going to store your own copy of their codebase and share it with others.

Having your own side project will not only show off your coding skills but also demonstrate your usage of version control and any other process that your project may incorporate.  Even if it is a simple one page app I would architect it in a way that would scale to an enterprise level application especially if you are applying for a senior role.  If you are applying for a junior role then just make sure the code is well organised, clean and functional.  Be prepared to demo the application and answer any questions over the decisions you made when building it.

If you have a good side project under your belt then it may save you the pain of the dreaded technical challenge.


## Keeps answers short and to the point

Be succinct in your answers and if you don't know then just say.  Interviewers would rather you were honest and tell them when you don't know an answer to their question rather than just giving a random answer in hope you fool them.  If you are being grilled about your technical knowledge then they will generally expect you to not know some of the answers.  The world of development is vast and no one knows everything.  The idea of the technical questions is to establish where you sit in terms of knowledge.  As an interviewer I would begin any technical questions with the ones that I deem relatively simple to boost the confidence of the candidate.  As time passes the questions will get more difficult and I will keep asking until I reach the limit of the candidates knowledge.

As an interviewee I have always enjoyed this part of the process.  It feels like a nerdy pub quiz to me and I tend to do well and enjoy it.  Treat it like an exam, prepare in advance and once again practice.  Most technologies out there will have a bank of publicly available interview questions and answers.  Don't just read the questions and answers though as you will believe you know them when you don't.  Write down all the questions separately and work through them without looking at the answers, better yet, get a friend over to quiz you while sipping on a glass of vino.

Don't just memorise the answers though, make sure you understand them.  The interviewer may press you for more details or ask your general thoughts on it.


## Remote interviews

Remote interviews are becoming much more common place especially since the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Check your environment

Make sure that you prepare the room that you will be sat in prior to the interview.  The last thing the interviewer wants to see is your unmade bed and dirty under garments strewn across the floor.  Sounds obvious but trust me I have seen it all.

This is especially important if the role you are interviewing for is fully remote.  I have seen candidates with their desk setup in the longe and the tv is on in the background with the kids running around.  You can't help but wonder if this is the most productive environment for someone to work in and how much it will impact their work.

Everyone's situation is different.  If you are lucky enough to have room in the house for a dedicated office then clearly that's where you want to sit.  If you don't have space for an office then try to find a nice quite tidy spot in the house away from any potential noise and interference (eg. your beautiful children).

### Check your tech

If your meeting invite arrives for the interview and it is using Google Meet and you have only ever used Zoom then fire up Google Meet.  Switch on the mic and camera to check it's all working.  You do not want to start the interview with technical issues.  To be honest, even if it is Zoom and it's something you use quite often check it's ok at least 10 minutes before the interview.  I've lost count the amount of times Apple have changed permissions on the mac and you have to go into settings to allow various apps access to you mic or camera.  Joining an interview without the camera or mic working and having to leave the interview to allow permissions and restart everything is once again not a great first impression.  The interviewers are likely to be very busy and would rather not have to waste time for these things... especially if you are the third or fourth person that day with technical difficulties.

### Check your bodily needs

Make sure you have fluids within reach to combat the dry mouth as a result of all the talking and nerves.  You don't want to get up halfway thought to grab a drink... especially if you threw a shirt and tie on but kept the cargo shorts on as they are below camera.  Also, make sure you have expelled any liquids etc. before hand so you don't have to take a toilet break.


### They need you more than you need them

This one depends on the position you are applying for but for a lot of senior developers this is the case.  My main key skill is Angular development and in my experience it is very hard to find good Angular developers.  If you already have a secure job and attending an interview because an interesting opportunity has arisen then having this mindset will help to combat those nerves.  That's not to say you should be obnoxious and over confident but just knowing that they potentially need you more than you need them will help you to relax and give a confident impression to the interviewer.  Just enjoy the process and learn from it even if you do fail.  The more interviews you attend then the more experience you will get.  Attending interviews when your life doesn't depend on it will help prepare you for the day when you may suddenly be out of work and desperate to secure a new role in fear of not being able to keep up with the mortgage repayments.
