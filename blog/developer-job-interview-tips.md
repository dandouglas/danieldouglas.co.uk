At the time of writing I have been working in the World of tech for about a decade.  In that time I have applied for 4 roles and have had a 100% success rate so far.  That's it, that's all I wanted to say.  I am clearly amazing and was always the best developer that had applied for the roles.

Ok that last part was probably not accurate... I don't know for sure but I would be willing to bet a small amount of money on the fact that I wasn't the best developer that was interviewed for each of those roles.

So why did I get offered the job and not any of the other candidates?

## Relax and try to enjoy it

Ok so I appreciate this is easier said than done but just try to relax, smile and enjoy the process.  First impressions go along way and meeting someone who is smiling will go along way to making that first impression a good one.

If you are relaxed and smiling then the chances are the interviewers will connect with you. One of the most important factors when interviewing for potential new employees is ensuring that they will be a good fit for the company regardless of technical abilities.  It also works the other way, if I was interviewed by someone who didn't even smile and made me feel uncomfortable then I wouldn't want to work for them.


## Dress appropriately for the company

This is very much related to my previous point about being a good fit for the company.  However, there is no hard and fast rule for what to wear to a job interview... particularly when applying for development roles.   You need to look into the company culture and the values that they deem important.

We've all seen tv programs about tech companies and startups with twenty something year olds zip wiring into the office in a pair of shorts and flip flops.  I would hazard a guess that if you turned up to an interview for a company like that dressed in a sensible grey three piece suite, shiny shoes whilst your nervous sweaty palms grip a briefcase then they may not think you will be a great fit.

On the same note, if it's a very corporate company where most of the employees dress in smart business attire and you turn up dressed like a skater.. the likelihood again is that will not see you as a great fit no matter what your technical skills are like.

I've picked a couple of extremes there but you get the point.  At the end of the day you will be spending a lot of time at work and you want to ensure it's an environment you feel comfortable in as well.  If you hate wearing business attire then don't apply for roles that require you to do so.

If you are unsure as to what the company culture is then I would pick an outfit that sits in the middle.  Go for smart casual... and remember to smile!

## Don't be late but don't be too early

I've interviewed for many roles and people that turn up late is never the greatest first impression.  There is rarely any good reason for being late... especially if you are interviewing remotely via video call.  If the interview is on premise then I always carry out a dry run before attending the interview.  Do the journey at least once to make sure you can find the building and know exactly where to park on the day if you are driving.  You do not want the stress of frantically trying to find parking or the building on the morning of the interview.  This will stress you out and you want be able to put on your best performance.

Equally don't be too early.  If you are too early it could potentially frustrate the interviewer who may feel obliged to stop what they are doing to interview you early as it's a small office and they don't want you hovering around the desks.  You also run the risk of bumping into another candidate and maybe they are super confident looking and then your brain decides that they are clearly better than you and you end up going to pieces through self doubt and nerves.

Get there 5 minutes early.. no later and no sooner.

## Practice your answers to common questions

I won't spend too much time on this one as there are plenty of other resources out there on common interview questions and example answers but just make sure you are ready for them.  You know the questions I am talking about... "What are your main weaknesses?" and "What can you bring to this company" etc..  No more so than the one that I will guarantee 100% that you will be asked "Tell me about yourself".

Personally I would keep the answers relatively short and avoid waffling.  In the past I have asked someone to tell me about themselves and they gave me their entire life story from birth.  For that particular question in tech I would concentrate on a brief overview of the profession technical aspects of your life but finish with a very short sentence about any hobbies or interests you have in hope of striking a common bond with the interviewer.  As this question is always asked very early on in the interview it gives you that opportunity to find common ground with the person you are talking to.


## Have a side project

Have at least one side project that shows off your technical skills.  It doesn't need to be extensive but just make sure that the code is cleanly written and demonstrates the skills you possess.  Please, please, please don't turn up to an interview and show them your current or any previous employers codebase... not unless you have been given prior consent.  I have stopped interviews short in the past when candidates have done this... especially when they start showing the intricacies of the authentication module.  An employer will not want you working for them if they think you are going to store your own copy of their codebase and share it with others.

Having your own side project will not only show off your coding skills but also demonstrate your usage of version control and any other process that your project may incorporate.  Even if it is a simple one page app I would architect it in a way that would scale to an enterprise level application especially if you are applying for a senior role.  If you are applying for a junior role then just make sure the code is well organised, clean and functional.  Be prepared to demo the application and answer any questions over the decisions you made when building it.

If you have a good side project under your belt then it may save you the pain of the dreaded technical challenge.
